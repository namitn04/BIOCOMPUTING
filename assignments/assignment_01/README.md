# Assignment 1 Command Log

The README.md, the output dir, the data dir, and the scripts dir were previously made in class.

ls -R **This command was helpful in the beginning and at the end of creating a mock project, as I don't have the tree command installed to see my repo architecture.**

mkdir -p data/{raw,ready}
mkdir -p scripts/{py,shell}
mkdir -p output/{raw,filtrd}  
mkdir -p config/{docs,logs}
touch data/raw/genome.fastq
touch data/ready/genome.fasta
touch output/raw/output.txt
touch output/filtrd/cleanput.csv
touch scripts/shell/test.sh
touch scripts/py/test.py
touch config/docs/setup.txt
touch config/logs/run_9_3_25.txt
touch assignment_1_essay.md

Overall, this was not difficult. I avoided doing multiple touch file creations in the same line, as it gave me better peace of mind to do it file-by-file.

Here's the command anyway: touch data/raw/genome.fastq data/ready/genome.fasta output/raw/output.txt output/filtrd/cleanput.csv scripts/shell/test.sh scripts/py/test.py config/docs/setup.txt config/logs/run_9_3_25.txt

I also used 'nano README.md' to edit this file and 'nano assignment_1_essay.md'.

I used ^C and ^X to save and exit the markdown files.
